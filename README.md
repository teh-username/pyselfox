# pyselfox

This yet another docker container containing Python (3.6), Selenium and Firefox (ESR). Docker build can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/tehusername/pyselfox/).

## Why another one

* Most of the images available are either based from Alpine itself or from Python but with Jessie as its base. This one uses Alpine as its base! (gotta get myself on that empty niche).

* Have you ever tried playing with Python and Selenium but gave up halfway because of the confusing mess that is the dependencies you have to install? Well, this image is for you! Focus on doing what needs to be done and make it run on a myriad of different environments without ever having to reinstall stuff!

## TODO

1) Add sample usage using Docker run
2) Add sample usage using provided docker-compose file
3) Building on your own
4) Pulling prebuilt container in dockerhub
